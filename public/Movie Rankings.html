<h1>The best movies According to Arpit</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 web series of all time.</h2>
    <hr \>
        <h3>Friends</h3>
          <p>
            This is the first web series that I watched.<br \>
            I really love the goofy characters and the story line of this film
          </p>
        <h3>Money Heist</h3>
          <p>
            This is the one that I love the most.<br \>
            It has many ups and downs throughout, and the series is unpredictable.
          </p>
        <h3></h3>
        <h3>Elite</h3>
          <p>
            The series Elite is based on teenagers,<br \>
            A lot of murders happen in this series.<br \>
            I finished it in like 5 days, and am eagerly waiting for new season to release.
